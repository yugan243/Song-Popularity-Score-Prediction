## 📖 Overview

**Song Popularity Score Prediction** is an end-to-end data science project that leverages machine learning to forecast the popularity of songs based on their audio features and metadata. By analyzing historical song data and extracting actionable insights, the project empowers artists, producers, and music industry professionals with data-driven predictions about which tracks have the potential to become hits.

### 🤔 Why Song Popularity Prediction?

Success in the music industry is often unpredictable. By using machine learning to analyze patterns in song attributes, this project makes the process of predicting hits more scientific and less of a guessing game, opening doors for strategic decision-making in music production and marketing.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on song datasets to uncover trends and correlations.
- 🧬 **Feature Engineering:** Extract and engineer features such as danceability, energy, tempo, and more.
- 🤖 **Model Building:** Implements multiple regression techniques (Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for popularity scoring.
- 📈 **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates models using MAE, RMSE, R², and visualizations.
- 🎯 **Prediction:** Predicts popularity scores for new/unseen songs based on input features.
- 🧪 **Interactive Notebooks:** All steps documented in Jupyter Notebooks for transparency and reproducibility.
- 🖼️ **Visualization:** Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for visually compelling insights.
- 🔄 **Scalable Pipeline:** Modular code structure for easy experimentation and extension.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a modular workflow:

- **Data Collection:** Loads song datasets (e.g., Spotify, Kaggle).
- **Preprocessing:** Cleans data, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generates relevant features from raw data.
- **Model Training:** Trains multiple regression models and tunes hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses models and selects the best performer.
- **Prediction:** Provides a user interface (via notebook or script) to predict song popularity.



## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📦 Prerequisites

- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Package Manager:** pip
- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive exploration
- **Dataset:** (e.g., Spotify tracks from Kaggle or your own CSV file)

### 💾 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yugan243/Song-Popularity-Score-Prediction
   cd Song-Popularity-Score-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Or for Windows:
   pip install -r requirements-windows.txt
   ```

### ⚙️ Configuration

1. **Prepare your dataset:**
   - Place your song dataset (`songs.csv` or similar) in the `data/` directory.

2. **Update configuration:**
   - Edit configuration cells/sections in the notebook for custom dataset paths or parameters.

3. **(Optional) Environment Variables:**
   - If you use environment-specific secrets, create a `.env` file:
     ```
     DATA_PATH=data/songs.csv
     ```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### 🏃 Running the Notebooks

- Open `Song-Popularity-Score-Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter.
- Step through each cell to perform EDA, train models, and predict scores.
- Alternatively, run Python scripts (if provided) for batch training or prediction.
